    "Here, we should use supervised clustering as there is training data available. Now, the Training data set is too small. So, we use K-Nearest Neighbor Clustering, because KNN is most useful when labeled data is too expensive or impossible to obtain, and it can achieve high accuracy in a wide variety of prediction-type problems. KNN is a simple algorithm, based on the local minimum of the target function which is used to learn an unknown function of desired precision and accuracy."
